## High Level
Walden aims to reconnect users with nature when they do not have easy access to it. Born from a desire to relax in nature, Walden capitalizes upon the immersive and untapped potential of virtual reality as well as previous research that laud nature's ability to reduce anxiety. Walden was built using Unity and Sebastian Lague's Youtube Channel, and uses procedural generation to create a new mountainous landscape each time the user opens the application. Then, using a Google Cardboard, the user can immersive themselves in a new environment each time they delve into the Cardboard application. Future iterations of Walden will include vegetation and spatial audio.

## More Technical Details
Walden is a Google Cardboard app for iPhone 8 built using Unity. A different landscape is created each time the application is opened, using random seed values as well as Perlin Noise functions. Though you cannot currently move in the landscape on mobile, you can explore the landscape within the Unity Editor itself. 

## How It Came to Be
With technology connecting us to more people over larger distances, society has come up with the destructive notion that being alone means being lonely. Sometime you need a quiet space to recollect yourself, and being on a college campus can make that feel impossible. I was walking through campus very late one November night and had finally found a place with no one else there, but as soon as I started to relax, a roudy group of party-goers ruined the peace. In that moment, I thought *"If I can't find a place to be alone, I'll create one"*. That is what inspired this project.
