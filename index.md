## High Level
Walden is meant to address the stress that oftentimes accompanies our increasingly urbanized lifestyle. For those who live in cities or, in the case of the creator, college campuses, it can be hard to find a space to be alone. Parks are crowded with other people, and living with roommates means not having your own space to completely unwind. With scientific literature suggesting that being in nature can reduce anxiety, Walden uses procedural generation to create a mountain landscape for the user to immerse themselves in

## More Technical Details
Walden is a Google Cardboard app for iPhone 8 built using Unity. A different landscape is created each time the application is opened, using random seed values as well as Perlin Noise functions. Though you cannot currently move in the landscape on mobile, you can explore the landscape within the Unity Editor itself. 

## How It Came to Be
With technology connecting us to more people over larger distances, society has come up with the destructive notion that being alone means being lonely. Sometime you need a quiet space to recollect yourself, and being on a college campus can make that feel impossible. I was walking through campus very late one November night and had finally found a place with no one else there, but as soon as I started to relax, a roudy group of party-goers ruined the peace. In that moment, I thought *"If I can't find a place to be alone, I'll create one"*. That is what inspired this project.
