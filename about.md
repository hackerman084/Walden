## Biography
My name is Astha Singhal and I am currently a sophomore computer science major in the University of Maryland, College Park. I'm involved in both the DCC Honors College Student Council and SASE(the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers) and love planning events that bring people together. I am currently the fundraising director of Engineering Playdate and the communications director of SASE. I play the guitar badly but passionately, and love to read and draw whenever I'm free! I'm actually working through Dance of Dragons right now. 

## Design Philosophy / Artist Statement
I've been interested in the intersection of art and computer science for a long time. After a few semesters of being a computer science major, I've realized that creativity and exploration are actions not encouraged by the computer science curriculum, which can be frustrating to those who fell in love with the innovative facets of CS. As a result, I'm more interested in the artistic / interdisciplinary side of CS, especially through machine learning or virutal/augmented technology. I believe that these technologies are capable of revolutionizing the way that we engage with the 'virtual', and want to ride that wave when it comes. I've been playing around with ARKit, and am looking to combine the possibilities of AR with image recognition to hack some cool projects!
