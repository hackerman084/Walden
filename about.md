## Biography
My name is Astha Singhal and I am currently a sophomore computer science major in the University of Maryland, College Park. Though I haven't been coding for long, through this capstone I realized that I like the more extended project style as opposed to the short/stressful hackathon project format, and hope to keep my github updated with future projects. I'm involved in both the DCC Honors College Student Council and SASE(the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers) and love planning events that bring people together. I play the guitar badly but passionately, and love to read and draw whenever I'm free!

## Design Philosophy / Artist Statement
I've been interested in the intersection of art and computer science for a long time. After a few semesters of being a computer science major, I've realized that creativity and exploration are actions not encouraged by the computer science curriculum, unless you don't sleep, which can be frustrating to those who fell in love with CS for its more innovative side. As a result, I'm more interested in the artistic / interdisciplinary side of CS, be it through machine learning or virutal/augmented technology, as I've bene exploring currently. I believe that these technologies are capable of revolutionizing the way that we engage with the 'virtual', and want to ride that wave when it comes.
