## What Happened?
The Capstone Fair is a celebration of all the hard work DCC students put over the course of the semester. Within 2 timeslots of 45 minutes each, everyone presents their project, inviting feedback and discussion over the meaning of their work!

## Reflection
### The Good
 A lot of people empathized when I explained that this project came from a desire to recollect myself, and thought that this was an interesting take on mindfulness. A lot of people gave me feedback on how to make the experience more immersive, suggesting spatial audio, more wildlife, and even music. It was really fun to see how people engaged with my inherently more personal project, and I enjoyed the experience! While some were also excited to see how this could translate with a more powerful medium, like the Gear or Rift, others like Professor Golub appreciated my intentions to keep it as accessible as possible. Interestingly enough, he mentioned that as an HCI researcher, it's hard to balance wanting to develop using the latest technologies while also making a product that helped the most people possible. It was a perspective that I've never encountered before, and I was overall grateful for the chance to engage with different people on a project I was extremely passionate about. 
 
### The Bad
I apologize to the first few people that I presented to! DCC is incredibly diverse, so while there were some people who were quizzing me about the platform I was using and the functions I used to create noise, there were also others who were asking about procedural generation on the whole. In the first few presentations, I took for granted how much people knew about procedural generation. I forgot that not everyone spent a semester studying and implementing procedural generation! I realized that I accidentally ended up talking too low-level, and so adapted my later presentations to be more high-level, and therefore more understandable. It was definitely a good opportunity to practice my communication skills!

### Overall 
I only got to witness the growth of my classmates' project over the course of the semester. We spent every Thursday in class, working our way through bugs and errors, but that was only a small selection of DCC. During the Capstone Fair itself, I got to see everyone's projects. It was incredible to see the amazing things people did when you gave them the space to be creative. From song visualizations to wildlife awareness, my classmates had incredibly creative projects, and it was an honor to be able to present alongside them.
